# Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in Finance

## Description

This Ai Core project aims to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer loan payment data. The process begins with extracting the data from an AWS Relational Database and transforming it into a pandas dataframe and a CSV file for subsequent processing and analysis.

The data undergoes several transformations including imputation and removal of null values, optimisation of skewness, outlier removal, and identification of correlations. After this, thorough analysis and visualization are performed to gain insights into the current state of loans, potential losses and indicators of risk.

The primary objective of this project is to delve into the loans_payment database through EDA to uncover underlying patterns, address data anomalies, employ statistical techniques for understanding data distribution, utilize visualization methods to discern patterns and trends, and ultimately present the findings in a clear and concise manner.
